# Global Food-and-Water Security-support Analysis Data (GFSAD)  resampling
SUMMARY
This code takes the input raster at 30 meters resolution and resamples the data to 5 arc min resolution for all files. The overall process of resampling high-resolution raster data to a lower resolution for analysis or visualization. 

Steps:
1. Import the required libraries and set up the working directory where all the rasters files are located.
2. Loop through the files ending with '.tif'
3. **Build Pyramids**: Use BatchBuildPyramids_management to build pyramids for each .tif file to improve performance when displaying raster data.
4. **SetNull**: Apply the SetNull function to replace raster values with NoData where the condition (Value=0) is met.
5. **Getting Raster Extent**: Retrieve the spatial extent of each raster file using the extent property.
6. **Clipping Raster**: Use the Clip_management function to clip the raster to the extent of interest.
7. **Creating Fishnet**: Generate a fishnet grid (polygon shapefile) that covers the extent of the clipped raster using CreateFishnet_management.
8. **Zonal Statistics as Table**: Calculate zonal statistics (mean) for the raster data within each cell of the fishnet grid and store the results in a table using ZonalStatisticsAsTable_sa.
9. **Adding Join**: Join the zonal statistics table to the fishnet grid shapefile using AddJoin_management.
10. **Converting Feature to Raster**
Convert the joined fishnet grid shapefile back to a raster format with the calculated mean values using FeatureToRaster_conversion.
11. **Subtracting a Constant Value** : Subtract 1 from the mean raster values using the Minus_sa tool.
12. Removing Layers and Tables from the Map: Remove all layers and tables from the map to clean up the workspace.
13. **Mosaicking Rasters** Use MosaicToNewRaster_management to combine multiple raster files into a single mosaic raster, with specified properties like pixel type, cell size, and mosaic method.
